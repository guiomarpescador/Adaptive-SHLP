# Adaptive-SHLP
Repository for 4th Year Project Mathematics University of Edinburgh: Adaptive Single Hidden Layer Perceptrons

The Template file contains all the necessary functions to run the Adaptive SHLP with activation function SReLU. The rest of the code follows from that example. 

The folders follow the same structure as the project itself and contains always two training methods Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent. 

The additional folders allow you to plot classification boundaries (even animated!) for planar data as well as the distribution of the adaptive parameter during training. 


Note: If the Jupyter Notebooks are not loading on GitHub you can use:  https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to visualise them.
